## MCP Tips

While the system comes with a default echo MCP Server, your LLM can access more powerful tools through MCP. Here's how to get started with two beginner-friendly tools: Fetch and Youtube-dl.

![Set MCP](./docs/ToolsManager.png)


### Quick Setup

Add this JSON configuration to your Dive MCP settings to enable both tools:

```json
 "mcpServers":{
    "fetch": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-server-fetch",
        "--ignore-robots-txt"
      ],
      "enabled": true
    },
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
        "/path/to/allowed/files"
      ],
      "enabled": true
    },
    "youtubedl": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@kevinwatt/yt-dlp-mcp"
      ],
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
```

### Using SSE Server for MCP

You can also connect to an external MCP server via SSE (Server-Sent Events). Add this configuration to your Dive MCP settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "MCP_SERVER_NAME": {
      "enabled": true,
      "transport": "sse",
      "url": "YOUR_SSE_SERVER_URL"
    }
  }
}
```

### Additional Setup for yt-dlp-mcp

yt-dlp-mcp requires the yt-dlp package. Install it based on your operating system:

#### Windows
```bash
winget install yt-dlp
```

#### MacOS
```bash
brew install yt-dlp
```

#### Linux
```bash
pip install yt-dlp
```
